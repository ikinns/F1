This is a simple Go (golang) program to scan the Wikipedia pages about Formula 1 racing. It finds all Wikitables
in the page and write the columns and rows to a csv file.

It uses @github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery

It was written after reading the Packt Publishing book "Go Web scraping - Quick Start Guide" by Victor Smith

I have included in this repository the output files from every F1 year from 1950 to 2019 after China.
This is the first 1000 races.
